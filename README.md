# LEGv8 #

This repository explains how to run LEGv8 assembly code using the ARM DS-5 Community Edition and the Linaro toolchain and simulator. LEGv8 is a simple version of ARMv8 defined and used in the book Computer Organization and Design - The Hardware/Software Interface ARM Edition by David A. Patterson and John L. Hennessy.

The [wiki](https://bitbucket.org/HarryBroeders/legv8/wiki/Home) explains how to set up the development environment and how to run a very simple LEGv8 assembly program.
